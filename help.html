            amount in the market which cannot be increased, unlike banknotes which can be printed.</p>

            <p style="color:black;">Crypto-Mining is the process of calculating hash values until you get a collision. As more
            crypto coins are mined, it becomes harder and harder to find a collision. Therefore, mining is often
            preformed in a group, where each member dedicates a piece of hardware to performing the needed calculations.
            Crypto-Mining is also done on the GPU, as it can perform calculations faster than the CPU.</p>
