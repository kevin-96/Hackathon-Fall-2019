          <p>Americans live in a credit oriented society. Many of the things we purchase are paid for at the end of the
            month.</p>
          <p>High interest rates add on to existing debt, limiting the purchases the average american can make daily.

          <p>Without the ability to apply for loans, the majority of americans would be unable to purchase houses.</p>
          <p>When someone loses a job, it becomes much harder to pay for mortgages and car loans so their homes and main
            mode of transport are at risk.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Upon graduation from high school, most students dont realize the impact that signing on to student loans
            can have on their lives. Since students are just barely reaching adulthood, they the financial experience
            they need to understand the amount that they're signing for.</p>
          <p>For this reason, student loan balances have ballooned across the country. There is a total exceeding 1.5
            trillion in student loan balances nationally. By becoming more informed about your options when paying for
            school, these figures can begin to come down and impact less american lives.</p>

          <h2>What is a Credit Card?</h2>
          <p>Credit cards are cards issued by banks that allow you to pay for purchases on credit. Credit cards have a
            credit limit which is the maximum balance you can carry on a card.</p>
          <h3>Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards</h3>
          <p>Credit card transactions involve borrowing money from the bank to complete a purchase. The bank determines
            a maximum amount that it is willing to lend (credit limit) and approves or declines a transaction based on
            account standing. Debit card transactions involve a checking account. Transactions made with debit cards are
            based on a bank account. They use money already allocated by the account holder and transactions are
            approved or declined based on that account balance.</p>

          <h2>What is a Mortgage?</h2>
          <p>Morgages are the loans that allow people to purchase a house and pay for it over a set amount of time.
            Unlike other loans, if defaulted on, lenders are able to take your house if there is non-payment.</p>
          <h2>Why do I need one?</h2>
          <p>In many cases, a home purchaser does not have the amount of money it costs to purchase a house. By getting
            a mortgage, they would not have to wait years to ammass the money required to purchase that house. While
            they allow for homes to be purchased earlier in life, there are also financial risks involved with
            mortgages. Payments could change if interest is variable.</p>
          <h2>Possible Expenses</h2>
          <p>The costs of owning a home go beyond paying for the actual house. There are also insurance costs to protect
            against emergency spending. Utility bills are also a consideration as rates can vary depending on location.
            Tax rates can also vary across town lines, further adding costs to a house.
            Check and make sure you know the details before commiting to a home.</p>
